I. Adding the barebox layer to your build
=========================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the barebox layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the barebox layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-barebox \
    "


II. Additional documentation
============================

The barebox layer has its own reference manual with detailed information about
its interface and how to use it.
The reference manual is located at "doc/ref-manual.rst" and can be exported to
either HTML or PDF via a makefile.
